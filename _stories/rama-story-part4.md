---

## Previously in the Ramayana

After forming an alliance with Sugriva and the monkey kingdom of Kishkindha, Rama has learned that Sita is imprisoned in Lanka, the island kingdom of the demon king Ravana. The monkey warriors spread out in all directions to search for Sita. Hanuman, son of the wind god and the greatest of Rama's devotees, leads the southern search party.

## The Search Begins

### The Southern Team

Hanuman led a team including:
- **Angada** - Vali's brave son
- **Jambavan** - The wise old bear
- **Other brave monkeys** - Each committed to finding Sita

They traveled through forests and mountains, searching everywhere, but found no trace of Sita.

### The Discouraged Searchers

Days passed. The search party grew discouraged:
- Their time limit was running out
- Sugriva would be angry if they failed
- They had found nothing
- The task seemed impossible

Jambavan, the wise old bear, counseled patience. "Remember who we serve. Lord Rama's cause is just. We must not give up."

But where could they search? They had looked everywhere!

## The Clue from Sampati

### The Giant Vulture

As the search party rested on a beach, discussing their failure, they saw an enormous vulture approaching. This was **Sampati**, the older brother of Jatayu (the brave bird who died trying to save Sita).

**Sampati's Story:**
- He had heard them talking about Rama and Sita
- "I know where Sita is!" he announced
- His brother Jatayu had fought valiantly and died
- From his mountain perch, Sampati had seen Ravana carrying Sita across the ocean to Lanka

### The Challenge

Sampati pointed across the vast ocean:
- "Sita is imprisoned in Lanka, beyond this ocean"
- "The island is 100 yojanas away" (about 800 miles)
- "No bridge connects it to the mainland"
- "Someone must leap across this mighty ocean"

The monkeys looked at each other in dismay. Who could possibly jump that far?

## Awakening Hanuman's Power

### The Young Monkey's Doubt

Hanuman stood quietly. Though he was the son of Vayu (the wind god) and had tremendous powers, he had forgotten his own strength. A curse from childhood made him unaware of his full capabilities.

**The Wise Counsel:**
Jambavan, who had lived for ages and knew everyone's history, spoke to Hanuman:

"O son of Vayu, do you not remember who you are?
- When you were a child, you thought the sun was a ripe mango
- You leaped into the sky to grab it!
- Indra struck you with his thunderbolt
- Your father Vayu became angry and withdrew all the air from the world
- The gods begged forgiveness and gave you many boons
- You have the strength to cross this ocean - and far more!
- Only YOU can accomplish this task"

### The Transformation

As Jambavan spoke, Hanuman remembered. The curse that kept him from knowing his own strength lifted.

**Hanuman's Realization:**
"I can do this! I WILL do this!"
- His body began to grow
- His confidence returned
- His devotion to Rama filled his heart
- "I will find Mother Sita or die trying!"

The other monkeys cheered. They had found their champion!

## The Mighty Leap

### Preparation

Hanuman climbed to the top of Mount Mahendra on the southern tip of India. From this peak, he would make his impossible leap.

**His Prayer:**
"Lord Rama, I leap in your service.
Mother Sita, I come to bring you hope.
Father Vayu, grant me your speed.
May I succeed in this mission!"

### Taking Flight

Hanuman pressed his feet into the mountain with such force that the mountain sank into the earth. Then, with a mighty roar, he launched himself into the sky!

**What He Looked Like:**
- Growing larger as he flew
- His tail streaming behind him like a banner
- Mountains seemed small beneath him
- The ocean stretched endlessly ahead
- But his heart was fixed on Rama

**The Teaching:**
When your heart is fixed on a noble purpose and you act with devotion, impossible tasks become possible.

## Obstacles on the Way

### The Mountain Mainaka

Halfway across the ocean, a mountain named Mainaka rose from the waters:

**Mainaka's Offer:**
"O great monkey, rest on my peaks!
- The gods sent me to offer you shelter
- Such a long journey requires rest
- Recover your strength here"

**Hanuman's Response:**
"Thank you, noble mountain, for your kindness!
- But I cannot rest until my mission is complete
- Mother Sita waits in sorrow
- Lord Rama depends on me
- I will rest only when I have seen her"

He touched the mountain peak respectfully and flew on.

**The Lesson:**
When on a sacred mission, don't get distracted by comforts, however kindly offered. Complete your duty first.

### The Serpent Surasa

Next, a great serpent named Surasa rose from the ocean:

**Surasa's Challenge:**
"No one crosses this ocean without entering my mouth!
- This is my boon from the gods
- You must fulfill this condition"

**Hanuman's Clever Response:**
Hanuman thought quickly. He said:
- "Very well, I will enter your mouth"
- "But first, open your mouth large enough to fit me"
- Surasa opened her mouth wider
- Hanuman grew larger
- She opened wider still
- He grew even larger!
- Finally, when she opened her mouth enormous wide
- Hanuman suddenly shrank to the size of a thumb
- He darted into her mouth and out in an instant!
- "I have fulfilled your condition!" he laughed

Surasa was delighted: "You have intelligence as well as strength! Go with my blessings!"

**The Lesson:**
Intelligence and quick thinking are as important as physical strength.

### The Demon Shadow-Catcher

A demon named Simhika lived in the ocean. She had the power to catch creatures by grabbing their shadows!

When Hanuman's shadow fell on the water, Simhika seized it, stopping him in mid-flight.

**The Battle:**
- Hanuman realized what was happening
- He grew smaller
- The demon opened her mouth to swallow him
- Hanuman grew enormous inside her
- He tore his way out, killing her
- Then continued his journey

**The Lesson:**
Even when mysterious forces try to stop you, determination and courage will see you through.

## Arriving at Lanka

### The Island Fortress

After crossing 100 yojanas of ocean, Hanuman finally saw Lanka:

**What He Saw:**
- A magnificent city on an island
- Golden buildings and jeweled palaces
- High walls and fortified gates
- Demon guards everywhere
- The entire island glowed with wealth and power

But Hanuman noticed something: "All this beauty was built with stolen wealth and maintained through fear. True dharma is missing."

### Entering the City

**The Problem:**
- The gates were guarded
- Demons patrolled the streets
- How could he search for Sita without being detected?

**The Solution:**
Hanuman waited for nightfall. Then he shrank himself to the size of a cat and slipped into the city through a small opening.

**What He Did:**
- Searched palace after palace
- Looked in gardens and groves
- Checked every building
- But did not find Sita

Hours passed. Dawn was approaching. Where could she be?

## Finding Sita

### The Ashoka Grove

Finally, Hanuman noticed one place he hadn't checked: a grove of Ashoka trees on the palace grounds.

**Entering the Grove:**
He climbed a tall tree and looked down. And there, sitting beneath an Ashoka tree, he saw a woman:
- Thin from fasting
- Dressed in soiled clothes
- Surrounded by demon guards
- But even in sorrow, radiating nobility and purity

It was SITA!

### Sita's Condition

Hanuman's heart broke seeing Mother Sita's state:

**How She Looked:**
- Her hair was tangled
- She wore the same clothes from the abduction
- She had been fasting
- Her face showed deep sorrow
- Yet her eyes showed unshakeable faith

**Why She Suffered:**
- Ravana came daily to convince her to marry him
- She always refused
- She remained absolutely faithful to Rama
- The demon women guarded her constantly
- She was threatened but never touched her dharma

**What She Did:**
- She kept a blade of grass between herself and Ravana
- This was her boundary - he could not cross it
- She spent her days thinking of Rama
- She trusted he would come for her

**The Teaching:**
Even in the darkest circumstances, you can maintain your purity and dharma. Sita's faithfulness never wavered, even when all seemed lost.

## First Contact

### How to Approach Her?

Hanuman faced a dilemma:
- If he appeared too suddenly, Sita might think he was another demon in disguise
- If he spoke too loudly, the guards would hear
- He needed to prove he came from Rama

**His Plan:**
- He would wait until Sita was alone in the early morning
- He would speak Rama's name
- He would show her proof

### The First Words

As dawn broke and the demon guards dozed, Hanuman softly began to sing:

**His Song:**
"There was a prince of Ayodhya, noble and true
His name was Rama, beloved of all
He lived in dharma, never wavering
His brother Lakshmana walked beside him
His beloved wife Sita was his heart
But a demon stole her and brought her to Lanka
Now Rama searches everywhere for his dear Sita..."

### Sita's Response

Sita heard the song. She looked up, searching for the source. Could it be? Was someone speaking of Rama?

She saw a small monkey in the tree. But he spoke so sweetly of Rama! She said:

"Who are you? Are you a dream?
Or another cruel trick by Ravana to torment me?
How do you know of Rama?"

## Proving His Identity

### Hanuman's Message

Hanuman bowed respectfully and replied:

"Mother Sita, I am Hanuman, servant of Lord Rama
- I am the son of Vayu, the wind god
- I have leaped across the ocean to find you
- Lord Rama lives! He has not forgotten you
- Even now, he prepares to come for you
- He has sent me ahead to give you this message
- And to bring him back word that you are alive"

But Sita was cautious. "How do I know you speak truth?"

### The Ring

Hanuman drew out something precious: Rama's ring!

"Lord Rama gave me this to show you
- Look, here is his name engraved on it
- This is the ring he always wore
- Only someone truly sent by him would have this"

When Sita saw the ring, she wept with joy and relief:
- "Rama has not forgotten me!"
- "He is coming!"
- "There is hope!"

She pressed the ring to her eyes and heart, overcome with emotion.

## The Conversation

### Sita's Message

After her tears of relief, Sita composed herself:

**Her Message to Rama:**
"Tell Lord Rama:
- I am alive but suffering greatly
- I can survive only two more months here
- If he does not come by then, I will end my life
- I remain faithful only to him
- My love and devotion are unchanged
- Please, let him come soon!"

### A Token for Rama

Sita removed a jewel from her hair - one of the few ornaments she had left:

"Take this to Rama
- He will recognize it
- He gave it to me at our wedding
- Let it be proof that you found me
- Let it remind him of our love"

### Hanuman's Counsel

Hanuman spoke gently but firmly:

"Mother, do not despair and do not think of ending your life!
- Lord Rama is mighty and will surely come
- Lakshmana is with him
- They have allied with Sugriva and the monkey army
- Even now they prepare to cross the ocean
- Your suffering will end soon
- Stay strong in your dharma
- The darkest hour is just before dawn"

**His Offer:**
"Mother, I can carry you back to Lord Rama right now!
- Climb on my shoulders
- I will leap back across the ocean with you
- You could be reunited today!"

### Sita's Dharmic Choice

Sita smiled sadly and refused:

"Beloved monkey, your offer shows your devotion
- But I cannot accept
- It would not be dharmic for another male to touch me
- Only Rama may rescue me
- Besides, Rama must defeat Ravana
- This demon has terrorized the three worlds
- If Rama does not punish him, adharma will grow
- My rescue must come through proper means
- Tell Rama to come with his army and dharma
- Let him defeat Ravana in righteous battle
- Then our reunion will be complete and proper"

**The Teaching:**
Even in desperate circumstances, Sita chose dharma over convenience. She understood that some things must be done the right way, even if it means more suffering.

## Hanuman's Fury

### The Burning Desire for Justice

Seeing Sita's suffering and hearing of Ravana's daily torment of her, Hanuman became furious. He thought:

"I cannot kill Ravana - that glory belongs to Lord Rama
But I can send him a message!
I can show him that Rama's servant has been here!
Let me create some chaos before I leave!"

### Destroying the Ashoka Grove

Hanuman began to grow. Larger and larger he became, until he was a giant!

**What He Did:**
- He uprooted trees in the Ashoka grove
- He destroyed Ravana's beautiful garden
- He broke marble pavilions
- He shattered fountains
- The demon guards came running
- He fought them all, defeating hundreds!

The commotion was enormous. All of Lanka heard it.

### Captured by Indrajit

Ravana's powerful son, Indrajit, came to fight Hanuman. After a great battle, he used a special weapon - a Brahmastra (a celestial missile) - to temporarily immobilize Hanuman.

**Out of Respect:**
Hanuman could have escaped even this weapon, but he thought:
- "I want to meet Ravana face to face
- I want to give him Rama's message personally
- Let me allow myself to be captured
- This serves my purpose"

**The Teaching:**
Sometimes strategic surrender serves a greater purpose than victory in every small battle.

## Before Ravana's Court

### The Confrontation

The demons bound Hanuman and dragged him before Ravana's throne.

**Ravana's Question:**
"Who are you? Why have you caused such destruction?
- Who sent you?
- What is your purpose here?"

**Hanuman's Fearless Reply:**
"I am Hanuman, servant of Lord Rama!
- I came searching for Mother Sita
- I found her in your Ashoka grove
- She suffers greatly because of you
- I destroyed your garden because it was built with stolen wealth
- Now hear my warning:
- Return Sita to Lord Rama immediately!
- Apologize for your crime!
- Seek his forgiveness!
- If you do this, you may survive
- If you refuse, Rama will come with his army
- He will destroy you and your entire kingdom!
- This is not a threat - it is the truth
- Adharma cannot stand before dharma"

### Ravana's Pride

Ravana laughed mockingly:

"You dare threaten me? I am Ravana!
- I have defeated the gods themselves
- I have conquered the three worlds
- No one can defeat me
- Let Rama come! I welcome the battle!
- I will never return Sita
- She will become my queen, whether she wishes it or not!"

**Hanuman's Response:**
"Then you have chosen your own destruction. So be it."

### The Tail on Fire

Ravana ordered: "Kill this monkey!"

But his brother Vibhishana (who was righteous and secretly sympathetic to Rama) advised:
"Brother, we should not kill a messenger. It is against dharma.
But we can punish him for the destruction he caused."

Ravana agreed: "Set his tail on fire! Let him return to Rama with a burned tail as a warning!"

**What They Did:**
- The demons wrapped Hanuman's tail with oil-soaked cloth
- They set it ablaze
- They paraded him through the streets of Lanka
- They wanted to humiliate him

But they made a terrible mistake. They forgot who they were dealing with.

## Burning Lanka

### Hanuman's Counterattack

As the demons paraded him through the streets with his tail on fire, Hanuman suddenly broke free!

**What He Did:**
- He shrunk his body but kept his tail long
- He leaped from building to building
- Everywhere his burning tail touched, fire spread
- Golden palaces burst into flames
- Marketplaces burned
- Guard towers collapsed in fire
- The demons ran in panic

**His Precision:**
- He carefully avoided harming innocent beings
- He made sure the Ashoka grove where Sita stayed was safe
- He burned only the demon strongholds
- He destroyed military installations
- But he protected civilians

**Lanka Burning:**
Soon, half of Lanka was in flames!
- The golden city glowed red with fire
- Demons screamed and ran
- Ravana's mighty fortress was humbled
- The supposedly invincible kingdom was burning!

**The Teaching:**
Those who try to humiliate dharma end up bringing destruction upon themselves. The very weapon they used against Hanuman became the instrument of their own devastation.

### Extinguishing the Flames

After setting Lanka ablaze, Hanuman dipped his tail in the ocean, extinguishing the flames. Then he thought:

"Wait! In my fury, did I harm Mother Sita? Is the Ashoka grove safe?"

Filled with worry, he rushed back to check on Sita.

## Saying Goodbye to Sita

### The Final Meeting

Hanuman returned to the Ashoka grove and was relieved to find it untouched by the fire.

**Sita's Words:**
"You have given Lanka a taste of what is to come when Rama arrives. Go now with my blessings. Tell Rama:
- I am alive and await him
- I can endure only two months more
- Let him come soon
- My faith in him never wavers"

**Hanuman's Promise:**
"Mother, within days Rama will be here with a mighty army.
- Keep your faith
- Your suffering will end soon
- Rama's love for you is as deep as the ocean
- He will come, and justice will be served"

### The Return Journey

Hanuman bowed to Sita one last time and prepared to leap back across the ocean.

**His Leap Back:**
- He was filled with joy at having found Sita
- He carried her jewel and her message
- He was eager to tell Rama the news
- His leap back was even faster than his journey there!

In moments, he crossed the hundred yojanas of ocean and landed back on the southern shore of India.

## Reunion with Rama

### The Joyful News

The moment Hanuman landed, the other monkeys surrounded him:
- "Did you find her?"
- "Is Mother Sita alive?"
- "What news do you bring?"

Hanuman rushed to where Rama waited anxiously. The moment Rama saw Hanuman's face, he knew there was good news.

### The Report

Hanuman fell at Rama's feet and said:

"My Lord, I have found Mother Sita!
- She is alive!
- She is imprisoned in Lanka in an Ashoka grove
- She remains completely faithful to you
- She refuses Ravana's demands
- She suffers greatly but her faith never wavers
- She sends you this jewel as proof
- She sends you her love and devotion
- She can survive two more months, she says
- She begs you to come soon"

### Rama's Response

When Rama heard that Sita was alive, tears of relief and joy flowed from his eyes:

**His Words:**
"My Sita lives! She is found!
- Hanuman, you have given me back my life
- How can I repay you?
- Ask anything of me!"

**Hanuman's Reply:**
"Lord, I need nothing but your affection
- To serve you is my only desire
- To succeed in your mission is my only reward
- Let me always remain your servant"

**The Teaching:**
True devotion seeks no reward except the joy of service. Hanuman, though he had performed an impossible task, wanted nothing for himself.

### The Detailed Account

Rama asked Hanuman to describe everything:
- How Sita looked
- What she said
- How she was being treated
- The layout of Lanka
- The strength of Ravana's forces

Hanuman told everything in detail. Rama listened, sometimes smiling at Sita's messages, sometimes weeping at the description of her suffering, always filled with love and determination.

## Preparing for War

### The Council of War

Rama called a meeting with:
- **Lakshmana** - his brother, ready to fight
- **Sugriva** - the monkey king, commanding the army
- **Hanuman** - who knew Lanka's layout
- **Jambavan** - the wise bear, counseling strategy
- **Angada** - brave and eager for battle

**The Discussion:**
"How will we cross the ocean?
- We have an army of millions of monkeys
- But the ocean is vast
- We cannot all leap like Hanuman
- What is our strategy?"

### The Plan Emerges

After much discussion, they decided:
1. **March to the southern shore** with the entire army
2. **Rama would pray** to Samudra (the ocean god) for passage
3. **If prayer failed**, they would find another way
4. **Then march to Lanka** and rescue Sita
5. **Defeat Ravana** and restore dharma

**Everyone's Vow:**
"We will not rest until Mother Sita is rescued!
We will not stop until Ravana is defeated!
Dharma will triumph over adharma!"

The monkey army raised a mighty cheer that echoed across the land.

## Lessons from Part 4

### The Power of Devotion

Hanuman's leap across the ocean was made possible by:
- His devotion to Rama
- His determination to serve
- His unwavering faith
- His focus on the mission

**Lesson:** When your heart is devoted to a noble cause, you can accomplish the impossible.

### Intelligence and Strength

Hanuman showed both:
- Physical strength (leaping the ocean)
- Intelligence (shrinking to enter Lanka)
- Wisdom (proving his identity to Sita)
- Strategic thinking (letting himself be captured)
- Quick thinking (using the burning tail as a weapon)

**Lesson:** True greatness comes from combining different abilities, not just physical power.

### Dharmic Choices in Crisis

Sita refused to let Hanuman carry her back because:
- It would compromise her purity (another male touching her)
- Rama needed to defeat Ravana properly
- The right way matters, even in suffering
- Justice must be served through dharma

**Lesson:** Even in desperate circumstances, choose the dharmic path, even if it means more hardship.

### The Humble Hero

Despite his incredible achievement, Hanuman:
- Asked for no reward
- Gave all credit to Rama
- Saw himself as just a servant
- Found joy only in serving

**Lesson:** True greatness is marked by humility. The greatest achievements are done without ego.

### Strategic Patience

Hanuman let himself be captured to:
- Meet Ravana face-to-face
- Deliver Rama's message personally
- Assess Lanka's defenses
- Create chaos at the right moment

**Lesson:** Sometimes apparent setbacks serve a larger strategy.

### Protecting the Innocent

Even in his fury, Hanuman:
- Protected Sita's grove from fire
- Avoided harming innocent beings
- Destroyed only military targets
- Used precision, not blind rage

**Lesson:** Even in war and anger, dharma requires protecting the innocent.
