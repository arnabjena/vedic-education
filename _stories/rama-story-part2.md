## The Turn of Fate

When we left off in [Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _stories/rama-story-part1.md %}), all of Ayodhya was celebrating. King Dasharatha had decided to crown Rama as the next king, and preparations were in full swing. The entire kingdom rejoiced.

But fate had other plans...

## The Two Boons

### Queen Kaikeyi's Maid

Queen Kaikeyi, Rama's stepmother, loved Rama dearly and was initially happy about the coronation. But her maid, Manthara, was wicked and jealous.

Manthara poisoned Kaikeyi's mind: "Are you foolish? Once Rama becomes king, your son Bharata will become irrelevant! You and Bharata will be at Rama's mercy! You must act now!"

### The Old Promise

Long ago, King Dasharatha had promised Kaikeyi two boons (wishes) for saving his life in battle. She had said, "I will ask when the time is right."

Now, poisoned by jealousy, Kaikeyi remembered those boons.

### The Night Before Coronation

The night before the coronation, King Dasharatha went to Kaikeyi's chambers, excited to share the joy. But he found the queen on the floor, disheveled and angry.

"What's wrong?" asked the confused king.

"I want my two boons," Kaikeyi demanded coldly.

"Of course! Ask anything!" said Dasharatha, not suspecting what was coming.

**First Boon:** "Make Bharata king instead of Rama."

Dasharatha was shocked but still hoped...

**Second Boon:** "Send Rama to the forest for fourteen years of exile."

### A Father's Anguish

King Dasharatha was devastated. He pleaded, begged, even offered to go to exile himself. But Kaikeyi was firm - she wanted both boons fulfilled.

The great king, who had never broken his word, was trapped between his love for Rama and his promise to Kaikeyi.

He spent the night in anguish, unable to speak to Rama.

## Rama's Response

### Morning Brings Cruel News

In the morning, Rama came to the palace in royal dress, ready for coronation. Instead, he found his father collapsed in grief and Kaikeyi waiting with her demands.

When Kaikeyi told Rama about the two boons, something extraordinary happened.

### The Test of Dharma

**Rama's immediate response:**

"Mother Kaikeyi, you should have simply asked me. There was no need to grieve father with these boons."

**To his father:** "Father, you must keep your word. A king's promise is sacred. Your dharma is to fulfill the boon. My dharma is to ensure you can keep your promise."

**Not a moment's hesitation. Not a word of complaint.**

### The Qualities Rama Showed

**Obedience:**
"My duty as a son is to ensure my parents' promises are kept."

**Non-Attachment:**
"What difference does it make where I live? The forest or the palace - neither defines who I am."

**Respect:**
Even to Kaikeyi who was hurting him, Rama showed no anger, only respect as his mother.

**Concern for Others:**
His worry was for his father's grief and dharma, not his own loss.

## Sita's Decision

### "I Will Come With You"

When Rama told Sita about the exile, he said, "You should stay in the palace. The forest is dangerous, full of hardships. You're a princess, not suited for such rough life."

Sita's response is one of the most powerful moments in the epic:

"Where you go, I go. You are my husband. My place is by your side, whether in a palace or a forest. The forest with you will be heaven; the palace without you would be hell."

"A wife's dharma is to be with her husband in all circumstances. I am not afraid of hardships. I am afraid of being separated from you."

### Rama's Attempts to Dissuade Her

Rama tried to convince her of the dangers:
- "There will be wild animals"
- "No comfortable beds, only grass"
- "No servants, only hard work"
- "No protection, only dangers"
- "You will miss your comforts"

### Sita's Firm Stand

To each argument, Sita responded:
- "I fear separation from you more than any beast"
- "The ground where you sleep will be softer than any bed"
- "Serving you is my joy, not a burden"
- "With you beside me, I am protected"
- "My only comfort is your presence"

Finally, she said: "If you refuse to take me, I will follow you into the forest anyway. But I prefer to go with your blessing."

Rama, seeing her determination and dharma, agreed. This would be their journey together.

## Lakshmana's Devotion

### "I Cannot Live Without You"

When Lakshmana heard about the exile, he was furious at the injustice. But more than anger, he felt one thing: he must go with Rama.

"Brother, I will not let you go alone. My place is by your side. I will protect you and sister Sita. I will serve you in the forest."

His wife Urmila understood and, though heartbroken, supported his decision. She would wait fourteen years for him.

### The Bond of Brothers

Lakshmana's devotion to Rama is legendary:
- He never thought of his own comfort
- His loyalty was absolute
- His service was selfless
- His love was complete

Three people would go into exile: Rama (who must go), Sita (who chose to go), and Lakshmana (who couldn't bear not to go).

## The Departure

### The Grief of Ayodhya

When news spread that Rama was going to exile:
- The entire city mourned
- People couldn't believe this was happening
- Children cried
- Even animals seemed sad
- The sun seemed less bright

Citizens begged Rama to stay, to fight the injustice. But Rama's dharma was clear: his father's word must be honored.

### Saying Goodbye

**To Father Dasharatha:**
Rama bowed and said, "Do not grieve, father. I go happily to fulfill your promise. When I return after fourteen years, I will see you again."

(But in his heart, Rama knew his father might not survive this grief.)

**To Mother Kausalya:**
His birth mother was devastated. Rama comforted her: "I go to uphold dharma. Your blessings will protect me. Take care of father."

**To the People:**
"Serve Bharata as you would serve me. He will be a good king. Wait for my return."

### The Journey Begins

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana left the palace:
- Rama drove the chariot himself
- Sita sat beside him in simple clothes
- Lakshmana took up his bow to protect them
- Half the city followed them to the forest edge

At the river Tamasa, they finally convinced the citizens to return. The three continued alone.

## Life in the Forest

### Meeting the Sage Bharadvaja

Their first stop was the ashram (hermitage) of Sage Bharadvaja near modern-day Allahabad. The sage welcomed them with great respect.

He offered them a place to stay, but Rama said, "We must go deeper into the forest, away from Ayodhya. Otherwise, people will keep following us, unable to accept the exile."

Bharadvaja directed them to Chitrakoot, a beautiful mountain region.

### Chitrakoot - The First Home

At Chitrakoot, Lakshmana built a simple hut (parnasala) with his own hands:
- Walls of bamboo
- Roof of leaves
- Floor of grass
- But made with love and care

This became their home. Despite the simplicity, they were content.

**Daily Routine:**
- Morning prayers and meditation
- Gathering fruits and roots for food
- Lakshmana hunting when needed (following dharma of kshatriya)
- Evenings discussing philosophy and dharma
- Nights under stars

### The Simple Life

From princes and princess to forest dwellers:
- No servants, they did everything themselves
- No fine clothes, wore bark and simple cloth
- No palace beds, slept on grass
- No royal food, ate wild fruits and roots

**But they were happy** because they were together and living according to their dharma.

## Bharata's Response

### Return from Visit

When Bharata returned from his maternal uncle's place (he was away during all these events), he was shocked to find:
- Rama gone
- Father dying of grief
- His mother Kaikeyi responsible
- Kingdom in mourning

### A Noble Heart

Unlike his mother's expectations, Bharata was devastated and furious at Kaikeyi:

"Mother, what have you done? You have destroyed our family! Rama is my beloved brother! I never wanted the kingdom!"

"You have killed father with this cruelty!"

King Dasharatha, heartbroken and unable to bear separation from Rama, passed away shortly after, calling out "Rama! Rama!" with his last breath.

### Journey to the Forest

Bharata refused to become king. Instead, he decided to bring Rama back. He went to Chitrakoot with the entire royal court, armies, and his youngest brother Shatrughna.

### Meeting at Chitrakoot

When Rama saw the huge procession approaching, Lakshmana thought it might be an attack. But Rama said, "No, that's my brother Bharata. He comes in love."

The meeting between the brothers was emotional:
- They embraced and wept
- Rama mourned his father's death
- Bharata begged Rama to return

### Rama's Firm Stand

Bharata: "Come back, brother! The kingdom is yours!"

Rama: "No, Bharata. Father gave his word. I must complete fourteen years."

Bharata: "But father is gone now. The promise ends!"

Rama: "Promises don't end with death. Especially not a king's promise. I will return when the fourteen years are complete, not a day before."

### Bharata's Solution

Seeing Rama would not return, Bharata said:

"Then I will stay here with you in exile."

Rama replied: "No, someone must rule Ayodhya. That is your dharma."

Finally, they reached a compromise:

Bharata would return to Ayodhya but would NOT sit on the throne. He would place Rama's sandals on the throne and rule as Rama's representative. He would live like an ascetic outside the capital in the village of Nandigram, waiting for Rama's return.

**If Rama did not return after fourteen years, Bharata vowed to enter fire.**

The brothers parted with tears and the understanding that both were doing their dharma.

## Deeper into the Forest

### Leaving Chitrakoot

After Bharata left, Rama decided to move deeper into the forest. Too many visitors came to Chitrakoot (citizens, sages, etc.), and he wanted to fulfill the exile completely.

They went to the forest of Dandaka, a wild and dangerous region.

### Meeting the Sages

Throughout their journey, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana visited various sages' ashrams:

**Sage Atri and Anasuya:**
Anusuya, the sage's wife, blessed Sita and gave her divine ornaments that never fade. She shared wisdom about being a devoted wife.

**Sage Agastya:**
The great sage gave Rama divine weapons and Vishnu's bow. He directed them to Panchavati, near modern-day Nashik.

### The Problem in Dandaka

The Dandaka forest was terrorized by demons (rakshasas) who:
- Attacked sages during their prayers
- Destroyed their hermitages
- Prevented sacrifices
- Spread fear

The sages pleaded with Rama to protect them. Though he was in exile and preferred peace, Rama's dharma as a kshatriya (warrior) was to protect the innocent.

He promised: "I will protect you from all demons."

## Panchavati - The Fateful Place

### Building a Home

At Panchavati, on the banks of the river Godavari, Lakshmana built another beautiful hut. This place had:
- Five great banyan trees (Panchavati means "five banyans")
- Beautiful scenery
- Abundant fruits and roots
- River for water

It seemed perfect. They settled in for what they hoped would be peaceful years.

### Life of Contentment

Despite being in exile:
- Rama and Sita were happy together
- Lakshmana served them devotedly
- They lived simply but joyfully
- Practiced meditation and dharma
- Enjoyed nature's beauty

Sita would gather flowers, Rama would discuss philosophy, Lakshmana would ensure their safety.

### The First Sign of Trouble

One day, a demoness named Shurpanakha, sister of the demon king Ravana, was roaming the forest. She saw Rama and was struck by his beauty.

She approached him in a beautiful form and said, "I am Shurpanakha. I want to marry you!"

Rama, amused, replied, "I am already married to Sita. But my brother Lakshmana is unmarried. Perhaps you should ask him."

When she approached Lakshmana, he said, "I am servant to Rama. You should marry the master, not the servant."

Being sent back and forth, Shurpanakha grew angry.

### The Attack

Suddenly, Shurpanakha revealed her true demon form and attacked Sita, jealous and enraged!

Rama signaled to Lakshmana, who immediately defended Sita and cut off Shurpanakha's nose and ears (a traditional punishment for such crimes in that era).

She fled, howling in pain and rage.

### The Consequences

Shurpanakha went crying to her brother Ravana, the powerful demon king of Lanka. She told him about Rama (exaggerating the offense) and described Sita's extraordinary beauty.

"Brother! There is a human prince in the forest with a wife more beautiful than anyone I've seen. He humiliated me! You must avenge me!"

**This was the beginning of the great conflict.**

Ravana, proud and lustful, decided he must have Sita for himself. He began plotting...

**Remember:** The Ramayana shows us that dharma isn't always easy or comfortable. Sometimes it demands great sacrifice. But those who follow dharma with faith and courage ultimately triumph. Rama's exile wasn't a punishment but a test that proved his divine character.

> "Rama proved that adherence to dharma, even in the face of extreme adversity, is the mark of true nobility."
