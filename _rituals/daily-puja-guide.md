## What is Puja?

**Puja** (pronounced "poo-jah") means worship or reverence. It's a ritual act of showing respect and love to the divine, performed with devotion and prescribed procedures.

### The Heart of Puja

While puja involves specific steps and materials, its essence is:
- **Bhakti** - Devotion and love for the divine
- **Shraddha** - Faith and sincerity

## Common Questions

### Do I need to do all 16 steps every day?

**No.** Start with basic steps (flowers, lamp, prayer). The key is consistency and devotion, not elaborate ritual. As you become comfortable, you can add more steps.

### What if I don't have all the materials?

**Improvise.** Water is enough for all liquid offerings. Single flower is enough. Even a mental offering with devotion works. God appreciates sincerity, not expensive materials.

### What if I make mistakes?

**Don't worry.** The closing prayer asks for forgiveness. God looks at your heart. Learn and improve gradually. Even great priests make mistakes.

### Can I do puja during menstruation?

**Traditional practice:** Women often don't do puja during menstruation.
**Modern understanding:** This is cultural, not spiritual law. If comfortable, pray from heart. God doesn't reject devotion for biological reasons.
**Personal choice:** Follow what feels right for you and your family tradition.

### Should I do puja if I'm not feeling devotional?

**Yes.** Often devotion comes AFTER starting puja, not before. The ritual itself creates the devotional mood. Like exercise - you don't always feel motivated, but you feel better after.

### What time should I do puja?

**Ideal times:**
- Early morning (4-6 AM) - Brahma muhurta (most auspicious)
- Morning after bath (6-9 AM)
- Evening (6-8 PM)

**Realistic approach:** Any consistent time that works for your schedule. Better to do at 9 PM daily than aim for 5 AM and skip.

### Can non-Hindus do puja?

**Yes.** Vedic tradition is inclusive. Puja is about devotion and connection with the divine, available to all sincere seekers. Respect and sincerity are what matter.
