⚠️ MANUAL IMAGE SETUP REQUIRED

The temple images need to be manually verified and added.

ACTION NEEDED:
1. Read: assets/images/temples/HOW_TO_ADD_IMAGES.md
2. Download verified Krishna, Rama, and Shiva images
3. Add 8 images to this folder with these exact names:
   - krishna-1.jpg
   - krishna-2.jpg
   - krishna-3.jpg
   - rama-1.jpg
   - rama-2.jpg
   - shiva-1.jpg
   - shiva-2.jpg
   - shiva-3.jpg

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
For now, I'll create a simple solid color placeholder so the site doesn't break.
The site will still work, but show placeholder colors instead of images.

Once you add the real images with the correct filenames above,
they will automatically appear on the website.
