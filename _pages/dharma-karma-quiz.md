- B) Sanchita (accumulated), Prarabdha (active), Kriyamana (being created)
- C) Past, present, future
- D) Mental, physical, spiritual

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Sanchita (accumulated), Prarabdha (active), Kriyamana (being created)</strong><br>
The three types are: (1) Sanchita - all accumulated karma from the past, (2) Prarabdha - the karma that's active and bearing fruit in this lifetime, and (3) Kriyamana - the karma you're creating right now with your current actions.
</details>

### Question 2
**Which type of karma can you change most easily?**
- A) Sanchita (accumulated)
- B) Prarabdha (active/ripening)
- C) Kriyamana (being created now)
- D) None of them

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: C) Kriyamana (being created now)</strong><br>
Kriyamana karma - the karma you're creating RIGHT NOW - is the one you have most control over. Every moment, you're choosing what thoughts to think, words to speak, and actions to perform. This is your power!
</details>

### Question 3
**What does "Nishkama Karma" mean?**
- A) Not doing any work
- B) Desireless action - doing your duty without attachment to results
- C) Only doing what you want
- D) Sleeping all day

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Desireless action - doing your duty without attachment to results</strong><br>
Nishkama Karma means doing your work with full effort but without being attached to whether you succeed or fail. You focus on doing the right thing, not on getting specific rewards. This is the ideal taught in the Bhagavad Gita.
</details>

### Question 4
**What factors affect your karmic results?**
- A) Only the action itself
- B) Intensity, intention, repetition, context, and knowledge
- C) Only your intention
- D) Nothing - it's all random

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Intensity, intention, repetition, context, and knowledge</strong><br>
Many factors affect karma: (1) How strongly you did it, (2) Why you did it (intention), (3) Whether you do it repeatedly, (4) The context and your role, and (5) Whether you knew it was wrong. Same action can have different karma based on these factors!
</details>

### Question 5
**According to the Bhagavad Gita, what does Krishna say about doing your own dharma?**
- A) Always copy others
- B) Better to do your own dharma imperfectly than another's perfectly
- C) Never do your dharma
- D) Everyone's dharma is the same

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Better to do your own dharma imperfectly than another's perfectly</strong><br>
Krishna teaches that it's better to follow your own unique path (svadharma), even if you make mistakes, than to perfectly follow someone else's path. Your own dharma is aligned with your nature and purpose.
</details>

### Question 6
**What are the three instruments through which karma is created?**
- A) Hands, feet, mouth
- B) Manas (mind), Vak (speech), Kaya (body)
- C) Past, present, future
- D) Good, bad, neutral

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Manas (mind), Vak (speech), Kaya (body)</strong><br>
Karma is created through: (1) Manas - your thoughts and intentions, (2) Vak - your words and speech, and (3) Kaya - your physical actions. All three create karmic consequences!
</details>

### Question 7
**What is "Prarabdha Karma"?**
- A) Karma you're creating now
- B) Karma from past that's actively bearing fruit in this lifetime
- C) Future karma
- D) Karma that doesn't exist

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Karma from past that's actively bearing fruit in this lifetime</strong><br>
Prarabdha karma is the portion of your accumulated karma that's "ripening" in this life - it's already in motion. You can't stop it, but you can change how you respond to it!
</details>

### Question 8
**How does intention (bhavana) affect karma?**
- A) Intention doesn't matter at all
- B) Only the action matters
- C) Pure intention can mitigate negative action; impure intention corrupts positive action
- D) Intention is everything; actions don't matter

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: C) Pure intention can mitigate negative action; impure intention corrupts positive action</strong><br>
Intention is very important! If you accidentally harm someone, the karma is less than if you did it on purpose. If you help someone but with selfish motives, the good karma is reduced. Why you do something matters!
</details>

### Question 9
**What is the difference between dharma and ordinary "duty"?**
- A) They're exactly the same
- B) Dharma is aligned with your nature and brings fulfillment; ordinary duty is just external obligation
- C) Duty is better than dharma
- D) Dharma is only for religious people

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Dharma is aligned with your nature and brings fulfillment; ordinary duty is just external obligation</strong><br>
Modern "duty" is often something you feel you "have to" do. Dharma is deeper - it's understanding your place in the world and acting from that understanding. Dharma brings satisfaction, not just obligation.
</details>

### Question 10
**What is "Samskaras" in relation to karma?**
- A) A type of food
- B) Mental impressions or grooves created by repeated actions
- C) A festival
- D) A building

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Mental impressions or grooves created by repeated actions</strong><br>
Samskaras are like grooves or impressions in your mind created by repeated thoughts and actions. They become habits and tendencies. This is how past karma affects your present - through these mental patterns!
</details>

## 📕 Hard Level (Ages 15+)

### Question 1
**How does the concept of karma balance the ideas of determinism and free will?**
- A) Everything is predetermined with no free will
- B) Everything is free will with no consequences
- C) Prarabdha karma sets some conditions, but kriyamana karma gives you free will in how you respond and create new karma
- D) There is no relationship between them

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: C) Prarabdha karma sets some conditions, but kriyamana karma gives you free will in how you respond and create new karma</strong><br>
Karma elegantly balances determinism and free will: (1) Your prarabdha karma (from past) creates certain life conditions you can't change - this is the "determined" part, (2) Your kriyamana karma (present choices) is completely free - you choose how to respond to conditions, (3) This means you're neither completely free nor completely determined. Between stimulus and response lies your freedom. As Viktor Frankl said, you can always choose your attitude. This is empowering, not fatalistic.
</details>

### Question 2
**What is the philosophical problem with using karma to explain suffering, and how should it be properly understood?**
- A) Karma perfectly explains all suffering
- B) Using karma to blame victims ("they deserved it") is a cruel misunderstanding; karma is about empowerment and responsibility, not judgment
- C) Karma has nothing to do with suffering
- D) Suffering doesn't exist

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) Using karma to blame victims ("they deserved it") is a cruel misunderstanding; karma is about empowerment and responsibility, not judgment</strong><br>
The misuse of karma doctrine to justify inaction or blame victims is wrong and un-compassionate. Proper understanding: (1) Karma is NOT about saying suffering is "deserved," (2) We don't see the full picture - never judge others' karma, (3) Compassion and helping those who suffer is itself good karma, (4) Using karma to justify not helping is itself bad karma, (5) Karma is about YOUR responsibility and empowerment, not judging others. The doctrine should make you more compassionate, not less.
</details>

### Question 3
**How does Nishkama Karma (desireless action) lead to psychological liberation even without believing in literal reincarnation?**
- A) It doesn't work without belief in reincarnation
- B) It breaks the cycle of desire-anxiety-disappointment by detaching from outcomes, creating mental peace and freedom from compulsive patterns
- C) It only works for monks
- D) It's impossible to achieve

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) It breaks the cycle of desire-anxiety-disappointment by detaching from outcomes, creating mental peace and freedom from compulsive patterns</strong><br>
Nishkama Karma is psychologically liberating because: (1) Attachment to outcomes creates anxiety before results, disappointment if you fail, and temporary satisfaction if you succeed (followed by new desires), (2) By focusing on excellent action without attachment to results, you: perform better (no performance anxiety), remain peaceful regardless of outcomes, find fulfillment in action itself, avoid cycles of hope and disappointment, (3) This is freedom from compulsive desire patterns, (4) You act from conscious choice, not from being driven by desires. This liberation works in one lifetime without requiring belief in reincarnation.
</details>

### Question 4
**What is the relationship between dharma and situational ethics? Is dharma relative or absolute?**
- A) Dharma is completely relative - anything goes
- B) Dharma is completely absolute - same rules for everyone always
- C) Dharma has both universal principles (absolute) and contextual application (relative) - svadharma depends on your nature, role, and circumstances
- D) Dharma doesn't relate to ethics

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: C) Dharma has both universal principles (absolute) and contextual application (relative) - svadharma depends on your nature, role, and circumstances</strong><br>
Dharma is neither pure relativism nor rigid absolutism: (1) **Universal Dharma** (Sanatana Dharma): principles like ahimsa, satya, asteya apply to all - this is the absolute component, (2) **Contextual Dharma** (Svadharma): same action can be dharmic for one person but not another based on role, nature, circumstances, (3) A warrior's dharma (to fight justly) differs from a sage's dharma (to teach peacefully), (4) This isn't "anything goes" but universal principles applied to particular contexts - like how physics laws are universal but applications differ, (5) This resolves the Gita's paradox: Krishna can ask Arjuna to fight because it's Arjuna's svadharma as a kshatriya warrior, not universal prescription for all.
</details>

### Question 5
**How does the concept of collective karma challenge Western individualism?**
- A) There is no collective karma
- B) Only individual karma exists
- C) Collective karma (family, national, cosmic) shows we're interconnected; our actions affect others and we share consequences, challenging the myth of the isolated individual
- D) Collective karma means no individual responsibility

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: C) Collective karma (family, national, cosmic) shows we're interconnected; our actions affect others and we share consequences, challenging the myth of the isolated individual</strong><br>
Collective karma reveals deep interconnection: (1) **Family Karma** (Kula Karma): families share karmic patterns, children inherit tendencies, family dynamics create shared experiences, (2) **National Karma** (Desha Karma): nations have collective karma from historical actions, citizens share some consequences (war, prosperity), (3) **Cosmic Karma** (Brahmanda Karma): all humanity shares some karma (climate change affects everyone), (4) This challenges Western individualism's myth of the isolated, independent self, (5) You're not solely responsible for everything in your life (collective karma influences you), but you ARE responsible for your responses and contributions, (6) It's both/and, not either/or: individual AND collective karma coexist.
</details>

### Question 6
**What is the significance of intention (bhavana) in karma philosophy, and how does this relate to ethical theory?**
- A) Only consequences matter (pure consequentialism)
- B) Only intentions matter (pure deontology)
- C) Karma considers both intention and consequences, integrating deontological and consequentialist ethics
- D) Neither matters

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: C) Karma considers both intention and consequences, integrating deontological and consequentialist ethics</strong><br>
Karma's treatment of intention is philosophically sophisticated: (1) **Not Pure Consequentialism**: Same action with different intentions creates different karma - killing in self-defense vs. murder, (2) **Not Pure Deontology**: Good intentions don't eliminate karmic consequences of harmful actions - you're still responsible for outcomes, (3) **Integration**: Karma evaluates BOTH intention (why you acted) AND consequences (what resulted), (4) This resolves the consequentialism-deontology debate in Western ethics - both matter, (5) Intention affects the TYPE and INTENSITY of karmic result, (6) This is more nuanced than either Western ethical school alone, (7) Example: Accidentally harming someone creates karma but less than intentional harm; helping with selfish motives creates good karma but less than pure service.
</details>

### Question 7
**How does the concept of Prarabdha Karma relate to the philosophical problem of evil and suffering?**
- A) It completely solves the problem of evil
- B) It shifts the question from "Why does God allow suffering?" to "What karma did I create?" - changing agency from external to internal
- C) It has no relation to the problem of evil
- D) It proves evil doesn't exist

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) It shifts the question from "Why does God allow suffering?" to "What karma did I create?" - changing agency from external to internal</strong><br>
Prarabdha karma reframes theodicy (problem of evil): (1) **Western Problem**: "If God is good and powerful, why is there suffering?" (blames external agency), (2) **Karmic Reframe**: "What actions led to this situation, and how can I respond?" (internal agency), (3) This shifts from complaint/blame to responsibility/empowerment, (4) Suffering isn't God's punishment but natural consequence of past actions (including collective karma), (5) This doesn't fully solve theodicy - still questions about initial conditions, collective karma you inherit, why system exists at all, (6) But it transforms your relationship with suffering from passive victim to active participant in your destiny, (7) CAUTION: Must not lead to victim-blaming; compassion remains essential regardless of karmic explanations.
</details>

### Question 8
**What does it mean that "samskaras" (mental impressions) carry forward but "memories" don't (in reincarnation view)?**
- A) It's a contradiction
- B) It shows karma operates at a deeper level than conscious mind - you inherit tendencies and patterns, not specific memories
- C) Nothing carries forward
- D) Everything carries forward

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) It shows karma operates at a deeper level than conscious mind - you inherit tendencies and patterns, not specific memories</strong><br>
This distinction is philosophically important: (1) **Memories** belong to the mind (manas), which is temporary and dies with the body, (2) **Samskaras** are deeper impressions in consciousness itself - they're patterns, not content, (3) You might not remember learning piano, but the skill (samskara) remains, (4) This explains: child prodigies (musical samskaras without memories), phobias without clear cause (fear samskaras), instant rapport with certain people (relationship samskaras), (5) It's like formatting a hard drive but hardware retains its capabilities, (6) This operates even without reincarnation: genetic inheritance, epigenetics, unconscious patterns, (7) Neurologically: procedural memory (how-to) vs. episodic memory (what happened) - samskaras are like procedural memory at soul level.
</details>

### Question 9
**How can dharma and karma be reconciled when dharma demands action (duty) but moksha requires transcending karma (beyond action)?**
- A) They're irreconcilable contradictions
- B) You must renounce all action for moksha
- C) Nishkama karma resolves this: perform dharmic action without attachment, which fulfills duty without creating binding karma
- D) Dharma and moksha are unrelated

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: C) Nishkama karma resolves this: perform dharmic action without attachment, which fulfills duty without creating binding karma</strong><br>
This apparent contradiction is resolved by the Gita's synthesis: (1) **The Problem**: Dharma requires action; moksha supposedly requires renunciation of action; these seem contradictory, (2) **The Solution**: Renounce the FRUITS of action, not action itself - this is karma-sannyasa, (3) **Nishkama Karma**: Perform your dharmic duty with full engagement but without personal attachment to results, (4) **Why This Works**: Binding karma comes from egoic attachment ("I am the doer, I want results"), not from action itself; selfless action performed as offering doesn't create binding karma; it actually BURNS existing karma, (5) **Practical Result**: You can live a fully engaged life (family, work, society) while progressing toward liberation, (6) **Not Inaction**: This isn't passivity or not caring - you act with excellence but remain internally free, (7) This is the "householder's path" - liberation while living in the world.
</details>

### Question 10
**What is the epistemological significance of dharma being contextual (svadharma) rather than universal rules?**
- A) It means there are no real ethical principles
- B) It recognizes that ethical wisdom requires phronesis (practical wisdom/judgment) to apply principles to unique situations - ethics is not just rule-following
- C) Everyone should do whatever they want
- D) Rules are always better than judgment

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
<strong>Answer: B) It recognizes that ethical wisdom requires phronesis (practical wisdom/judgment) to apply principles to unique situations - ethics is not just rule-following</strong><br>
Svadharma's contextuality reveals sophisticated ethical epistemology: (1) **Not Rule-Based Ethics**: Simple rules can't cover all situations; same action can be right or wrong depending on context, (2) **Requires Practical Wisdom**: You need discrimination (viveka) to understand your unique situation, role, capacities, and how universal principles apply, (3) **This is Aristotle's Phronesis**: Practical wisdom to apply general principles to particular cases - ethics isn't just knowing rules but wise application, (4) **Develops Moral Maturity**: You must think, not just obey; you're responsible for understanding context; this creates moral agents, not moral rule-followers, (5) **Acknowledges Complexity**: Real life involves conflicting duties, unclear situations, competing goods - rigid rules break; wisdom flexes, (6) **Dangers**: Requires developed conscience and guidance; immature judgment can rationalize anything as "my dharma"; this is why guru, scripture, tradition provide guidance, (7) **Ultimate Point**: Ethical living requires both universal principles AND situational wisdom to apply them.
