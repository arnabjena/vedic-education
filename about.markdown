## Why This Matters Today

Despite being ancient, Vedic wisdom addresses timeless human questions:

✨ **Who am I?** - Understanding your true nature
✨ **What is my purpose?** - Finding meaning in life
✨ **How should I live?** - Ethics and dharma
✨ **What is real?** - Nature of reality
✨ **How can I be happy?** - Path to lasting fulfillment
✨ **What happens after death?** - Understanding consciousness

Modern science is increasingly validating many Vedic concepts:
- Meditation and yoga for health and wellbeing
- Holistic approaches to medicine
- Interconnection of all life
- Power of consciousness

## A Note on Language

We present this wisdom in **English, not Sanskrit**. While Sanskrit terms are used when necessary (like "dharma" or "karma"), we always explain them clearly. Our goal is education, not language learning.

For those interested in Sanskrit, we provide:
- Proper transliteration
- Pronunciation guides
- Etymology when relevant
- Links to deeper study
