## Introduction to the Vedas

The Vedas are the oldest sacred texts of India and among the oldest religious texts in the world. The word "Veda" comes from the Sanskrit root "vid" (विद्), meaning "to know." They are called "Shruti" (श्रुति) - that which was heard - because they were revealed to ancient seers (rishis) and transmitted orally with extraordinary precision for thousands of years before being written down.

### Why "Heard" and Not "Written"?

According to Vedic tradition, the Vedas were not composed by humans but were "seen" or "heard" by enlightened rishis in deep meditative states. They are considered:
- **Apaurusheya** - Not of human origin
- **Nitya** - Eternal truths
- **Anaadi** - Without beginning

This doesn't diminish their value; rather, it emphasizes that they represent universal truths discovered through profound spiritual insight.

## Structure of the Vedas

Each Veda has four parts:

### 1. Samhitas (संहिता) - "Collections"
The core text containing mantras and hymns. This is what people usually mean when they say "the Vedas."

### 2. Brahmanas (ब्राह्मण) - "Explanations"
Prose texts explaining the rituals, their meaning, and procedures. They provide context and commentary.

### 3. Aranyakas (आरण्यक) - "Forest Treatises"
Texts meant for meditation in forests, forming a bridge between ritual (Brahmanas) and philosophy (Upanishads).

### 4. Upanishads (उपनिषद्) - "Sitting Near"
Philosophical texts exploring the nature of reality, self, and ultimate truth. These form the culmination of Vedic wisdom.

> Was there water, bottomlessly deep?"

This hymn questions the very origin of existence, ending with:

## Preservation of the Vedas

### Oral Tradition

The Vedas were preserved through:

**1. Pada Patha (पदपाठ)**
- Word-by-word recitation
- Ensures each word is clear

**2. Krama Patha (क्रमपाठ)**
- First word + second word
- Second word + third word
- Ensures continuity

**3. Jata Patha (जटापाठ)**
- Complex interwoven pattern
- Like a braid
- Ensures no word is lost

**4. Ghana Patha (घनपाठ)**
- Most complex pattern
- Words repeated in multiple combinations
- Ultimate safeguard

This sophisticated system ensured that the Vedas have been transmitted with almost no textual corruption across thousands of years - a remarkable achievement in human history.

### Vedic Schools (Shakhas)

Different schools preserved different recensions:
- Originally 1,000+ shakhas existed
- Today about 10-12 survive
- Each with slightly different recensions
- All respected as authentic
