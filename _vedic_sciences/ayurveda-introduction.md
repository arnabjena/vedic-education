## What is Ayurveda?

**Ayurveda** (आयुर्वेद) literally means "Science of Life" from Sanskrit:
- **Ayur** (आयुः) = Life, longevity
- **Veda** (वेद) = Knowledge, science

Ayurveda is the traditional Indian system of medicine that has been practiced for over 5,000 years. Unlike modern medicine which primarily treats disease, Ayurveda focuses on preventing illness and maintaining optimal health through balanced living.

### Origins

**Traditional Account:**
- Revealed to ancient sages through meditation
- Compiled by sage **Charaka** (Charaka Samhita - Internal medicine)
- And sage **Sushruta** (Sushruta Samhita - Surgery)
- Part of Atharva Veda
- Continuously practiced and refined for millennia

**Historical Reality:**
One of the world's oldest continuously practiced medical systems, influencing Tibetan, Chinese, and Greek medicine.

### Core Philosophy

**Ayurveda views health holistically:**
- Body, mind, and spirit are interconnected
- Health is balance; disease is imbalance
- Each person is unique (personalized medicine)
- Prevention is superior to cure
- Nature provides healing
- Food is medicine
- Lifestyle matters as much as treatment

## The Five Great Elements (Pancha Mahabhuta)

Ayurveda teaches that everything in the universe, including the human body, is made of five elements:

### 1. Akasha (Space/Ether)
- **Quality:** Expansiveness, openness
- **In Body:** Body cavities, channels, spaces
- **Function:** Provides space for everything to exist

### 2. Vayu (Air)
- **Quality:** Movement, dryness, lightness
- **In Body:** Breath, nerve impulses, circulation
- **Function:** All movement and communication

### 3. Agni (Fire)
- **Quality:** Heat, transformation, sharpness
- **In Body:** Metabolism, digestion, intelligence
- **Function:** Transformation and conversion

### 4. Jala (Water)
- **Quality:** Fluidity, coolness, cohesion
- **In Body:** Blood, lymph, saliva, all fluids
- **Function:** Lubrication and nourishment

### 5. Prithvi (Earth)
- **Quality:** Solidity, heaviness, stability
- **In Body:** Bones, muscles, tissues
- **Function:** Structure and stability

**The Principle:**
These five elements combine in different proportions to create three fundamental energies called **Doshas**.

## Determining Your Dosha

### Prakriti vs. Vikriti

**Prakriti (प्रकृति):**
Your natural constitution - the unique combination of doshas you were born with. This never changes.

**Vikriti (विकृति):**
Your current state - how your doshas are balanced right now. This changes based on lifestyle, season, age, etc.

**Goal:** Bring your Vikriti (current state) back to your Prakriti (natural state).

### Assessment

Most people are **bi-doshic** (two doshas dominant) or **tri-doshic** (relatively balanced):
- **Vata-Pitta**
- **Pitta-Kapha**
- **Vata-Kapha**
- **Vata-Pitta-Kapha** (rare, balanced)

**How to Determine:**
Consult an Ayurvedic practitioner for accurate assessment. They will examine:
- Physical characteristics
- Mental tendencies
- Digestion patterns
- Health history
- Pulse (Nadi Pariksha - sophisticated diagnostic technique)
- Tongue
- Eyes

**Self-Assessment (Rough Guide):**
Answer these questions thinking about your lifelong tendencies, not current temporary states.

## Agni: The Digestive Fire

**Agni** is central to Ayurvedic health - it's the digestive and metabolic fire that:
- Digests food
- Processes experiences
- Transforms nutrients
- Burns toxins
- Maintains immunity

### Types of Agni

**Sama Agni (Balanced):**
- Regular appetite
- Good digestion
- Proper elimination
- Clear complexion
- Good energy

**Vishama Agni (Irregular - Vata imbalance):**
- Appetite varies
- Sometimes strong, sometimes weak
- Gas and bloating
- Constipation alternating with loose stools

**Tikshna Agni (Sharp - Pitta imbalance):**
- Very strong appetite
- Can eat large quantities
- Gets angry if meal is delayed
- Tendency toward acidity

**Manda Agni (Slow - Kapha imbalance):**
- Weak appetite
- Heavy feeling after eating
- Slow digestion
- Tendency to gain weight

**Goal:** Maintain Sama Agni (balanced digestive fire).

## Ama: Toxins

**Ama** (आम) means "undigested" or "toxins" - the sticky waste product of incomplete digestion that:
- Clogs channels (srotas)
- Weakens agni further
- Is the root cause of most diseases
- Creates feeling of heaviness

**Signs of Ama:**
- Coating on tongue (especially white)
- Bad breath
- Feeling of heaviness
- Lack of appetite
- Fatigue
- Cloudy urine
- Sticky stools

**Clearing Ama:**
- Fasting or eating lightly
- Drinking warm water
- Ginger tea
- Simple, easily digestible foods
- Spices that kindle agni
- Cleansing practices (under guidance)

## Dinacharya: Daily Routine

Ayurveda places tremendous emphasis on daily routine (Dinacharya). Following natural rhythms maintains balance.

### Morning Routine (6-10 AM - Kapha Time)
