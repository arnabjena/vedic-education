## What is Yoga?

The word "Yoga" (योग) comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj" (युज्), meaning "to yoke," "to unite," or "to join." Yoga is the science and art of uniting the individual consciousness with universal consciousness - reconnecting the jivatma (individual soul) with Paramatma (Supreme Soul).

### Common Misunderstanding

**In the West:** Yoga = Physical postures (asanas) for fitness and flexibility

**In Reality:** Asanas are just one of eight limbs; Yoga is a complete philosophy and practice for spiritual realization

### What Yoga Really Is

**A Complete System:**
- Philosophy of consciousness
- Methods for mind control
- Ethical foundation
- Physical practices
- Breathing techniques
- Meditation practices
- Path to liberation (moksha)

**Goal:** To still the fluctuations of the mind and realize one's true nature

## Patanjali's Yoga Sutras

### Structure

The Yoga Sutras are organized in four chapters (padas):

**1. Samadhi Pada (51 sutras):**
- Nature of Yoga
- Types of minds
- States of consciousness
- Samadhi (absorption)

**2. Sadhana Pada (55 sutras):**
- Practice (sadhana)
- Eight limbs of Yoga
- Obstacles and solutions
- Klesha (afflictions)

**3. Vibhuti Pada (56 sutras):**
- Supernatural powers (siddhis)
- Higher states of consciousness
- Samyama (concentration, meditation, absorption combined)

**4. Kaivalya Pada (34 sutras):**
- Liberation (kaivalya)
- Nature of consciousness
- Ultimate freedom

### The Famous First Sutras

**Sutra 1.1:**
> "Atha yoga anushasanam"
> "Now, the teaching of Yoga [begins]"

**Sutra 1.2 (Most Famous):**
> "Yogash chitta vritti nirodhah"
> "Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind"

**Meaning:**
- Yoga = stilling the mind
- Chitta = mind-stuff, consciousness
- Vritti = fluctuations, modifications
- Nirodha = cessation, control

When the mind becomes still, one realizes their true nature.

**Sutra 1.3:**
> "Tada drashtuh svarupe avasthanam"
> "Then the Seer abides in its own true nature"

When mental fluctuations cease, you realize yourself as pure consciousness - the eternal witness.

## The Five Vrittis (Mental Fluctuations)

The mind constantly fluctuates through five types of modifications:

### 1. Pramana (प्रमाण) - Valid Knowledge

**Three Types:**
- **Pratyaksha:** Direct perception through senses
- **Anumana:** Inference and reasoning
- **Agama:** Testimony from reliable sources

These are valid ways of knowing.

### 2. Viparyaya (विपर्यय) - Misconception

**False knowledge:**
- Misperception
- Illusion
- Mistaking rope for snake
- Identifying body as self

### 3. Vikalpa (विकल्प) - Imagination

**Mental constructs:**
- Fantasy
- Conceptualization without basis in reality
- Worry about future (which hasn't happened)
- "What if" thinking

### 4. Nidra (निद्रा) - Sleep

**Deep sleep:**
- Consciousness present but no mental activity
- Still a vritti because it's a modification
- Different from samadhi (superconscious state)

### 5. Smriti (स्मृति) - Memory

**Recollection:**
- Past experiences
- Stored impressions (samskaras)
- Can be accurate or distorted

**Goal:** Not to stop these completely (impossible while living) but to control and eventually transcend them.

## The Eight Limbs of Yoga (Ashtanga)

Patanjali's systematic path to self-realization:

### 1. Yama (यम) - Ethical Restraints

**Universal moral principles:**

**Ahimsa (अहिंसा) - Non-violence**
- Not harming any being in thought, word, or deed
- Extends to self (no self-harm)
- Foundation of all other yamas

- When established, your words manifest

**Asteya (अस्तेय) - Non-stealing**
- Not taking what isn't freely given
- Includes time, attention, credit

### 3. Asana (आसन) - Physical Postures

**Patanjali's Definition:**
> "Sthira sukham asanam"
> "Asana is a steady, comfortable posture"

**Purpose in Yoga Sutras:**
- Prepare body for meditation
- Ability to sit still for long periods
- Steady and comfortable

- **Kumbhaka:** Retention
- **Rechaka:** Exhalation

**Purpose:**

**The Bridge:**

- Gateway to Antaranga (inner limbs)

### 6. Dharana (धारणा) - Concentration

**Single-Pointed Focus:**
- Fixing attention on single point
- Could be: breath, mantra, deity, chakra
- Sustained attention
- Mind returns when it wanders

**Practice:**
- Choose an object
- Focus completely
- Gently return when mind wanders
- Gradually extend duration

**Challenge:**

### 7. Dhyana (ध्यान) - Meditation

**Unbroken Flow:**
- Effortless sustained focus
- Like oil flowing from container

**Difference from Dharana:**
- Dharana: Repeated efforts to focus
- Dhyana: Effortless sustained focus
- Like flame in windless place

**Experience:**
- Deep absorption
- Time seems to stop
- Subject-object division fades
- Peace and clarity

**Duration:**
- Traditionally: 12 dharanas (144 seconds) = 1 dhyana

**Not:**

- But direct experience/awareness

### 8. Samadhi (समाधि) - Absorption/Union

**Ultimate Goal:**
- Complete absorption
- Union with object of meditation
- Transcendence of ego

**Types:**

**Samprajnata Samadhi (with seed):**
- Still aware of object
- Subject-object distinction subtle but present
- Four stages based on object:
  - Vitarka: Gross object
  - Vichara: Subtle object
  - Ananda: Blissful
  - Asmita: Pure I-am-ness

**Asamprajnata Samadhi (seedless):**
- Beyond all objects
- Pure consciousness alone
- All samskaras (impressions) dissolved
- Liberation (kaivalya)

**Duration:**
- 12 dhyanas = 1 samadhi
- But ultimately beyond time

**Experience:**
- Indescribable
- Beyond words
- Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss)
- Realization of true Self

---

## The Three Inner Limbs: Samyama

When Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi are performed on same object, together they constitute **Samyama** (संयम).

**Power:**

- Source of siddhis (powers)
- Key to higher consciousness

**Application:**
Can be applied to:
- Physical objects

## Conclusion

Yoga is not just a practice but a complete way of life. It offers a systematic path from where you are to where you want to be - from limitation to freedom, from ignorance to wisdom, from suffering to peace.

The beauty of Yoga is that it works at all levels:
- **Body:** Health and vitality
- **Energy:** Balance and strength
- **Mind:** Clarity and peace
- **Intellect:** Discrimination and wisdom
- **Spirit:** Realization and liberation

You don't need to be flexible, calm, or spiritual to begin. Yoga meets you where you are and gradually transforms you. The practice itself creates the practitioner.

**Remember Patanjali's two keys:**
1. **Abhyasa (अभ्यास):** Consistent practice
2. **Vairagya (वैराग्य):** Non-attachment

Practice regularly without attachment to results. This is the essence of Yoga.

> "Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the Self." - The Bhagavad Gita

Begin where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. The transformation will come naturally with sincere, sustained practice.
